By default, you should use `GET` method to call the API.\n### ORD\n`ORD` represents **order**. It:\n* Gives the index of the current API.  \n* Suggests a recommended form of representing the current API.\n\n## Response\nCurrently, we only respond your request in forms of JSON. Please notice that there are three possible situations that our API may respond:\n### Success\nIf `success` is `true`, `content` will be the desired response.  \n``` json\n{\"success\": true, \"content\": {...}}\n```\n### In Query\nIf `success` is `false` AND `query` in `content` is `true`, `status` will be the status of current request.<br>\nIf this occurs, please retry your request every few seconds.  \n``` json\n{\"success\": false, \"content\": {\"query\": true, \"status\": {...}}}\n```\n### Failed\nIf `success` is `false` AND `query` in `content` is `false`, `reason` will be the explanation for failure.  \n``` json\n{\"success\": false, \"content\": {\"query\": false, \"reason\": {...}}}\n```\n\n## TimeStamp\nIn order to fix AJAX bugs for Internet Explorer, you should better add a timestamp parameter (e.g. `ts`).",
